# GOAT 🐐
*Go Orchestration & Automation Toolkit*

---

## Introduction

**GOAT** (Go Orchestration & Automation Toolkit) is a backend engine for building workflow automation systems. Written in Go, GOAT provides the core components for orchestrating complex tasks across distributed services. It is designed for developers and DevOps engineers who need a robust foundation to create custom automation platforms, integrate internal tools, or embed workflow capabilities directly into their own applications. With a modular plugin architecture, developers can easily extend GOAT with new integrations and share them as reusable modules.

---

## Features

- **Workflow Engine**: Define and execute multi-step workflows
- **Modular Plugin System**: Easily add new triggers and actions
- **Trigger & Action Nodes**: Compose workflows from modular building blocks
- **Execution Engine**: Robust, concurrent workflow execution
- **Webhooks**: Receive and process external events
- **Scheduling**: Run workflows on a schedule (cron-like)
- **REST API**: Manage workflows and executions programmatically
- **Execution Logs**: Track workflow runs and debug failures
- **Extensible**: Add custom plugins for new integrations

## Example Usage

**Sample Workflow Definition (YAML):**
```yaml
name: "Send Slack Alert on New GitHub Issue"
triggers:
    - type: github.issue.created
        repo: your-org/your-repo
actions:
    - type: slack.send_message
        channel: "#alerts"
        message: "New GitHub issue: {{trigger.title}}"
```

**API Usage (Create Workflow):**
```http
POST /api/workflows
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "name": "Send Slack Alert on New GitHub Issue",
    "triggers": [{ "type": "github.issue.created", "repo": "your-org/your-repo" }],
    "actions": [{ "type": "slack.send_message", "channel": "#alerts", "message": "New GitHub issue: {{trigger.title}}" }]
}
```
