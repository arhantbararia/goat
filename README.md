## Introduction

**GOAT** (Go Orchestration & Automation Toolkit) is a powerful backend automation engine inspired by platforms like Zapier, IFTTT, and n8n. Built in Go, GOAT enables developers and teams to automate workflows by connecting triggers and actions across services. It solves the problem of repetitive manual tasks and complex integrations, making automation accessible for backend engineers, DevOps, and SaaS builders.

## Features

- **Workflow Engine**: Define and execute multi-step workflows
- **Modular Plugin System**: Easily add new triggers and actions
- **Trigger & Action Nodes**: Compose workflows from modular building blocks
- **Execution Engine**: Robust, concurrent workflow execution
- **Webhooks**: Receive and process external events
- **Scheduling**: Run workflows on a schedule (cron-like)
- **REST API**: Manage workflows and executions programmatically
- **Execution Logs**: Track workflow runs and debug failures
- **Extensible**: Add custom plugins for new integrations
